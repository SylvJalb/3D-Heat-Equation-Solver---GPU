![TO DO](./equation-in-french.png)

# Execute solvers

If you want testing and compare CPU and GPU solvers:    
''' bash
make && heatTest.x
'''

To compile and run CPU solver:    
''' bash
make && mainCPU.x
'''

To compile and run GPU solver:    
''' bash
make && mainGPU.x
'''

Solutions will be save in VTK files format.
